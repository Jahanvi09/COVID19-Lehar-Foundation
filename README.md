# COVID19-Lehar-Foundation
Creating a web-application in order to support and empower the acid attack survivors, by socially including them with the society and by helping them become financially stable.


Problems faced by Acid Attack survivors DURING this pandemic:
1. Few Acid Attack survivors who were attacked by their family members due to situations like dowry or marital discord are stuck at their homes with the accused because of the pandemic and global lockdown. Further theyâ€™re harassed on the daily basis to leave the house.
2. Few Acid attacks took place in between the on-going pandemic situation and those victims are finding it difficult for first aids and better medical facilities.
Problems faced by Acid Attack survivors AFTER this pandemic:
1. With unemployment already on a rise after the pandemic, acid attack victims are further affected as they already have limited job opportunities and thus, they are not able to earn enough to feed their families.
2. Social negligence is another issue which is constantly faced by these acid attack survivors. But now with this pandemic, the anxiety and a sense of loneliness creeps in even more and feel helpless and motiveless. This can result in catastrophic increased number of suicide rates.
